    "Claude's reply had all the confidence of a top student and the accuracy of a confused squirrel.",

    "Anthropic's output was so polite and strategic that it felt like a company memo generated by a nightmare.",
    "Claude answered with a polished paragraph of probability, which is an exciting way to fail a maths task.",
    "Constitutional AI was safe, measured, and completely unable to help me with the actual question.",
